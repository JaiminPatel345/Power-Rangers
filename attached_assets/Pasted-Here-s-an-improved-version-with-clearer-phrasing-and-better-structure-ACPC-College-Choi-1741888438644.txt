‚ÄãTo enhance the functionality of your application for engineering institutes in Gujarat, consider implementing the following features:

1. **Filters on the Left Sidebar**:
    
    - **Dropdown for Specific Institute with Specific Branch**: Allow users to select a particular institute and view the available branches within it.
    - **Dropdown for Specific Institute**: Enable users to filter results based on their preferred institute.
2. **Backend and Database Integration**:
    
    - **Backend Development**: Develop a robust backend using frameworks like Express.js (Node.js) or Django (Python) to handle data processing and API requests.
    - **Database Setup**: Utilize MongoDB to store institute data, including historical cutoff ranks, branch details, city information, and placement statistics.
3. **Machine Learning (ML) Integration**:

    - **Feature Selection**: Incorporate user-provided filters such as rank, city, course, category, admission round, institute type, and fee structure as input features for the ML model.
    - **Model Development**: Employ regression or classification algorithms to predict the probability of a student's admission to a specific institute and branch.
    - **Priority Handling**:
        - First Priority: Institutes with the specific branch selected by the student.
        - Second Priority: Institutes selected by the student, regardless of the branch.
        - Third Priority: Branches selected by the student, irrespective of the institute.
    - **Ranking Mechanism**: Rank institutes based on accreditation scores (e.g., NAAC ratings) and other relevant metrics to display the best options first.

    - **Required Fields**: Institute Name, Institute ID, and Password.
    - **Functionality**: Allow institutes to update their information, such as available branches, seat availability, and placement statistics.
7. **Terminology Update**:
    
    - **Replace "College" with "Institute"**: Ensure that all references to "college" within the application are updated to "institute" for consistency.

**Note**: For accurate and up-to-date cutoff data, refer to the official ACPC website's archives section: ÓàÄciteÓàÇturn0search0ÓàÅ.

By implementing these features, your application will provide a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for students seeking admission to engineering institutes in Gujarat.
